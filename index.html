		<h5>Re:Search</h5>
		<p>By far my biggest, and most time consuming project, Re:Search is a game created for
		the UC Davis Biodmedical Department, with the main goal of preparing university freshmen
		for undergraduate research. Through a series of chapters within the game, the player is
		introduced to historical research figures and common research methods and practices.</p>
		<p>My role is this project is to create the environment art and the art for the user interface.
		To create the environment art I first designed the level, then created the tiled within Aseprite, 
		compiled the tiles and set the colliders within Tiled, and then imported the completed maps to Unity.</p>
