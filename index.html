				<p>By far my biggest, and most time consuming project, Re:Search is a game created for
				the UC Davis Biomedical Department, with the main goal of preparing university freshmen
				for undergraduate research. Through a series of chapters within the game, the player is
				introduced to historical research figures and common research methods and practices.</p>
				<p>My role is this project is to create the environment art and the art for the user interface.
				To create the environment art I first designed the level, then created the tiled within Aseprite, 
				compiled the tiles and set the colliders within Tiled, and then imported the completed maps to Unity.</p>
				
				<h4>The Yum Yum Project</h4>
